Lite Plate is a very simple CMS and it should NOT be considered totally secure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Install:
1.) Copy all files into your web directory
2.) Either:
  -import "install_lite_plate.sql" using phpmyadmin
  -or using the terminal: 
    $ mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE lite_plate;"
    $ mysql -u root -p lite_plate < install_lite_plate.sql 

  -Note:
    -Importing using phpmyadmin will work on any system on which it is installed
    -The bash commands will work only on a system running the base shell (i.e. Linux)

Getting Started:
  Things to know:
    -Content for dynamic pages is stored in the mySQL database 'lite_plate'
    -Static pages can be created by copying 'index.php' to a new file and adding content manually
    -Two global constants exist at the moment:
      -'DOC_ROOT' this represents the location of your web directory 
        -(e.g. '/var/www/', or '/wamp/www/', etc...)
        
      -'WEB_ROOT' this represents the base url of your website
        -(e.g. 'http://localhost/', or 'http://yourdomainname.com/', etc...)
    -There is NO backend, yet... I know it is crucial, but at the moment dynamic content must be added using
     phpmyadmin
     or a command line based mySQL client
    -There are huge holes, I'm sure your aware of them. It is a work in progress so feel free to add where
     needed. It is a small system so you should be able to add whatever you need without bloating it.
